# Mastermind
Created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.

### Functionality

This is the [Mastermind](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/mastermind) project, which plays a simple game of Mastermind, allowing the player to be either the codemaker or codebreaker.

### Thoughts

This project was a good exercise in tackling complexity by abstracting with higher level methods.

The most difficult part was creating the logic for codemaker mode. Although it's easy to come across strong Mastermind strategies online, I found that they quickly become messy when I started trying to implement them. The hardest part was having information from previous guesses carry onto the next guess. Logic for how to display Red and White lights in Codebreaker mode was another really challenging part as there are so many possiblities and solutions all depending on how accurate you want to be!
